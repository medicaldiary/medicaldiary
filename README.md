Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how our app deals with the personal identifiable information.

The android permission ‘android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS’ is used only for direct email sending from the application. Emails are only sent when specified by the User, during data backup or data export. Disabling this permission will only effect the ability to send emails from the application directly. More information on the email functionality can be found here: https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-email-composer.
